# Simplechain

Super simple blockchain implementation for educational purposes.

### Motivation

This is based upon [naivechain](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain), but has been separated out into distinct modules for readability, and tests added as each part of the implementation was considered and refactored. The original naievechain code is concise and clear, but for me, the process of writing these tests and removing the http server, and peer-to-peer communication components away from the blockchain implementation has meant that there is much more clarity in the implementation specifics. 

See [this blog post](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54#.dttbm9afr5) for the original naievechain implementation details.

### What is blockchain
[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) : Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks secured from tampering and revision.

### Concepts

* RESTful HTTP interface to control nodes
* No proof-of-work or proof-of-stake (yet).

### Quick start
(set up two connected nodes and mine 1 block)
```
npm install
HTTP_PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=6001 npm start
HTTP_PORT=3002 P2P_PORT=6002 PEERS=ws://localhost:6001 npm start
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data '{"data" : "Some data to the first block"}' http://localhost:3001/mineBlock
```

### Quick start with Docker
(set up three connected nodes and mine a block)
###
```sh
docker-compose up
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data '{"data" : "Some data to the first block"}' http://localhost:3001/mineBlock
```

### HTTP API
##### Get blockchain
```
curl http://localhost:3001/blocks
```
##### Create block
```
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data '{"data" : "Some data to the first block"}' http://localhost:3001/mineBlock
``` 
##### Add peer
```
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data '{"peer" : "ws://localhost:6001"}' http://localhost:3001/addPeer
```
#### Query connected peers
```
curl http://localhost:3001/peers
```
